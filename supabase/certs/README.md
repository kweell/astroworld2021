# Supabase database CA

`prod-ca-2021.crt` is a public root CA certificate, not a private key or credential.
It is trusted only by this project's PostgreSQL client when
`SUPABASE_DB_CA_PATH=supabase/certs/prod-ca-2021.crt` is configured.

Source: [Supabase's certificate download](https://supabase-downloads.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/ssl/prod-ca-2021.crt),
confirmed against the `ssl:certificate_url` entry in the
[official dashboard source](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/hooks/custom-content/custom-content.json).

- Subject: Supabase Root 2021 CA, Supabase Inc
- Expires: 26 April 2031, 10:56:53 UTC
- SHA-256 fingerprint: `80:70:25:AD:50:D4:ED:21:9D:2C:9C:7D:29:9C:00:4F:82:4E:B0:0C:F7:F6:5A:FE:F6:07:D0:7B:72:E6:CA:FA`

If Supabase rotates the certificate or your project uses a different CA, download
the applicable certificate from its Database Settings → SSL Configuration section
and update the file/path. The client keeps `rejectUnauthorized: true` to verify the
certificate chain and hostname.
